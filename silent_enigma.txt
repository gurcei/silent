- 1st verse
In dreamland grandeur
  - A little girl peaks from behind a tree
I held mesmerized peace
  - She stand on tip-i-toes, hand above her eyes, admiring the few from left to right

Innocence breathed again
  - she takes timid steps forward and stops
  - each time, a few more than last
    (gaining confidence to venture ahead)

A mind's escape
  - She begins to run
Leave walls of tears behind
  - She leaps with enthusiasm as she runs through the forest

Ethereal vision haunting still...
  - Runs until reaches an enormous tree

The solitude left me blind
  - She embraces the trunk of the large tree
  - the tree pulses with energy in response to her embrace

Beneath an open sky

Sibilant cries of youth dying

Enslave me with grief

A moonlit era, oblivion's twilight kiss

Wishes in lament

Happiness in a broken vision

Utopia still unborn...


Tormented echoes of a fallen Eden

I longed for her beauty

Yet from dust, she returned

The dream, an enigma... silent
