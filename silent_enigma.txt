Stretch ideas
=============
- Extend MEGAPlot to plot entire cube? (for speed)
- Line drawing on sprite overlays
- Explore OPL3 to supplement music with drums
- Study how MegaAssembler handles multi-file projects
  - Could Eleven do similar?

- 1st verse
In dreamland grandeur
  - A little girl peeks from behind a tree
I held mesmerized peace
  - She stand on tip-i-toes, hand above her eyes, admiring the few from left to right

Innocence breathed again
  - she takes timid steps forward and stops
  - each time, a few more than last
    (gaining confidence to venture ahead)

A mind's escape
  - She begins to run
Leave walls of tears behind
  - She leaps with enthusiasm as she runs through the forest

Ethereal vision haunting still...
  - Runs until reaches an enormous tree

The solitude left me blind
  - She embraces the trunk of the large tree
  - the tree pulses with energy in response to her embrace

--------
- Beneath an open sky
- Sibilant cries of youth dying
- Enslave me with grief
- A moonlit era, oblivion's twilight kiss
- Wishes in lament
- Happiness in a broken vision
- Utopia still unborn...

- In this section, skip the lyrics, and just send greetings to community members
--------

Tormented echoes of a fallen Eden

I longed for her beauty

Yet from dust, she returned

The dream, an enigma... Silent...
